## Group Project Collaborations

### Working as a team on GitHub

As a team on GitHub, we efficiently collaborated by pulling the main project, branching off to work on individual tasks, and pushing our contributions back to GitHub. We coordinated the merging of approved branch changes, providing us with a transparent overview of our progress, contributions, and how they seamlessly integrated into the project.

### Collaborations
In MySQL, Lauren and Jessica designed a skincare database consisting of tables named Results, SkinInfo, and Users. These tables store data related to different skin types, skincare routines, and products tailored to each skin type.

The development of an accompanying application was a collaborative effort by Nasra, Mimi, Minka, and Remi. Nasra handled the creation of API endpoints, while Mimi, Minka, and Remi collectively worked on the db_utils.py and Main.py files.

As a result, users can now select skincare routines based on their specific skin types.


### Brainstorming
We collaborated by sharing examples of our desired end result and the specific data we aimed to generate for user consumption. Our process unfolded as follows:

#### Collaborating on the type of API we wanted to create
![images of links](API%20Discussion.png) 

#### Collaborating on how we want the app to look
![images of mocqups](App%20Mock%20Mimi.png)

## Main.py

- ### First we import the requests and json modules.

- #### For user Interaction, the run() function is the main entry point.It displays a welcome message and interacts with the user to guide them through a skincare routine selection process.

- #### Several functions are created to interact with the skincare service via API calls.

- #### show_skin_type(): Allows the user to choose their skin type from a list of options retrieved from the API.

- ### daily_routine_by_skintype(skintype): Retrieves and displays the daily skincare routine for the selected skin type.

- #### add_new_member(): Prompts the user to become a member, where they provide personal information such as first name, last name, email, skin type, and age. This information is sent to the API.

- #### add_new_member_to_api(FirstName, LastName, Email, SkinType, Age): Sends a POST request to the API to add a new member.

- #### delete_member(email): Sends a DELETE request to the API to delete a member's account using their email.

- #### It then checks if it's the main program entry point (if __name__ == '__main__') and calls the run() function.

- #### This provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a skincare routine based on skin type and allows users to become members. It communicates with the API to retrieve and send data related to skincare routines and member information. Additionally, it offers the option to withdraw membership by deleting the user's account through the API.





## App.py

#### For our app we used a Flask-based web application. It serves as a REST API to interact with a skincare database. It exposes endpoints to retrieve skin types, daily routines, add new members, and delete members based on their email addresses. Here's an overview of what the code does:

### Imports:

#### We have imported necessary modules such as Flask, jsonify, request, and functions from the db_utils.py file.

### Flask Application Setup:
#### An instance of a Flask application is created.

### API Endpoints:

### The application defines several API endpoints:

- #### /skintype (GET): This endpoint is used to retrieve a list of skin types. It calls the get_skintype_list() function from db_utils.py and returns the result as JSON.

- #### /daily-routine/<skintype> (GET): This endpoint is used to retrieve the daily routine for a specific skin type. It takes the parameter <skintype> in the URL and calls the get_daily_routine(skintype) function from db_utils.py to fetch the routine. The result is returned as JSON.

- #### /members (POST): This endpoint allows the addition of new members. It expects JSON data with fields like FirstName, LastName, Email, SkinType, and Age. The add_member() function is called to add the new member to the database. If successful, it returns a success message as JSON.

- #### /members/<email> (DELETE): This endpoint is used to delete a member based on their email address. It calls the delete_member_by_email(email) function from db_utils.py. Upon successful deletion, it returns a success message as JSON.

## Main Execution:

- The script checks if it's the main program entry point (if __name__ == '__main__') and runs the Flask application.

- It sets the application to run in debug mode and listens on port 5001.






## Db_utils.py

#### This code connects to the MySQL database called Skincare. It performs various database operations like, fetching skin types, retrieving daily routines, adding members to a skincare database, and deleting members by email. Here's an overview of what the code does:

## Importing Modules and Variables:

- The script imports the mysql.connector module to interact with the MySQL database.
It also imports variables USER, PASSWORD, and HOST from a config module, to establish the database connection.
### Custom Exception:

-The DbConnectionError class is defined as a custom exception class for handling database connection errors.

Database Functions, the script defines several functions for database interactions.

- get_skintype_list(): Retrieves a list of distinct skin types from the dailyroutine table in the database.

- get_daily_routine(skintype): Retrieves the daily routine for a given skintype from the dailyroutine table in the database.

- add_member(FirstName, LastName, Email, SkinType, Age): Adds a new member to the members table in the database, providing member details.

- delete_member_by_email(email): Deletes a member from the members table in the database based on their email address.

### Main Execution:

- The script checks if it's the main program entry point (if __name__ == '__main__') and performs several test operations.

- It fetches a list of skin types and displays them.

- It retrieves the daily routine for a specific skin type and displays the routine.

- It adds a test member to the database and prints a success message.

- Finally, it attempts to delete a member with the email 'bb' from the database.





# Database

#### A MySQL skincare database was created to define tables, insert data, and show queries. The database has tables for results, user information, and skincare preferences. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

### Database Creation and Selection:

- A new database named "skincare" was created using the CREATE DATABASE statement.
The USE skincare statement selects the "skincare" database for use.


### Error Handling (Transactions):

- The code wraps the SQL statements within a transaction using START TRANSACTION to ensure data consistency and integrity during the execution of multiple statements.
Table Creation:

### Three tables are created:
- Results Table: This table stores information about skincare results. It has fields for results ID, skin description, skincare routine, recommended products, and a foreign key to the "SkinInfo" table.
- SkinInfo Table: This table stores user-specific skin information, including skin type, age, ethnicity, gender, environment, medication, and a foreign key to the "Results" table.
- Users Table: This table is related to users and contains fields for user ID, first name, last name, email, username, and foreign keys to the "Results" and "SkinInfo" tables.

### Data Insertion:
- Data is inserted into the "Results," "SkinInfo," and "Users" tables using the INSERT INTO statements. Sample data for different skin types and users is provided.
Data Retrieval:

- The code includes SELECT statements to retrieve data from the "Results," "Users," and "SkinInfo" tables.

### Table Joins:
- The code performs table joins using INNER JOIN statements to combine data from different tables. For example, it joins the "Users," "SkinInfo," and "Results" tables to retrieve specific user-related information.
Additions to Consider:

- The code includes comments about potential SQL queries that could be used for specific tasks, such as retrieving skincare data, getting skincare routines by skin type, listing available skin types, and deleting all skincare data.

### Error Handling (Commitment):

- The transaction is committed using the COMMIT statement, which finalises the changes made to the database.

This sets up the basic structure of the skincare database, populates it with initial data, and provides queries for accessing and manipulating the data.
