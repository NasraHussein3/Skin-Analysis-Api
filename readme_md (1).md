# Skin Care Analysis API

## Introduction

Welcome to the Skin Analysis API â€“ your personal skincare companion, offering customized regimens tailored to your unique skin type. We base our recommendations on The Ordinary skincare products to help you achieve healthy and radiant skin.

In the development of this API, we used the following tools:

1. **Flask Web Framework:** We've implemented Flask, a web framework, to create the web application.

2. **Jsonify:** This library enables us to provide JSON responses, making it easy for users to understand and work with the data.

3. **Request:** The Request library allows us to handle incoming data, such as the JSON input provided by users.
